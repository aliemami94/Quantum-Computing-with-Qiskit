This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that demonstrates the fundamental principles of quantum computing using IBM's open-source framework, Qiskit. The notebook provides a hands-on introduction to building, simulating, and visualizing simple quantum circuits.

Files
Quantum Algorithm-Copy1.ipynb: The main Jupyter notebook.

Key Concepts Explored
The notebook illustrates several key concepts in quantum computing:

Quantum Circuit Creation: How to initialize a quantum circuit with qubits and classical bits.

Quantum Gates: Application of basic quantum gates such as the Hadamard gate (h) and the CNOT gate (cx).

Measurement: Measuring the state of qubits to collapse them to a classical bit value.

Simulation: Using the qasm_simulator backend to run the quantum circuit and obtain measurement results.

Visualization: Drawing the quantum circuit to better understand the flow of operations.

Prerequisites
To run this notebook, you will need to have Python and the following libraries installed:

qiskit

qiskit-aer

numpy

matplotlib (for visualization)
