⚛️ Quantum Computing with Qiskit
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that serves as a hands-on introduction to quantum computing using IBM's open-source framework, Qiskit. The notebook guides you through building, simulating, and visualizing simple quantum circuits.

📁 Files
Quantum Algorithm-Copy1.ipynb: The core Jupyter notebook for the project.

💡 Key Concepts Explored
The notebook demystifies the world of quantum computing by illustrating several fundamental concepts:

Quantum Circuit Creation: Learn how to construct a quantum circuit by initializing qubits (the quantum equivalent of bits) and classical bits to store measurement results.

Quantum Gates: Apply essential quantum gates like the Hadamard gate (h) to create superposition and the CNOT gate (cx) to entangle qubits.

Measurement: Understand how measurement collapses a qubit's state into a definite classical value (0 or 1).

Simulation: Use the qasm_simulator backend to run the quantum circuit and get real-world-like results without needing a physical quantum computer.

Visualization: Visualize the quantum circuits to gain an intuitive understanding of the flow of quantum operations.
